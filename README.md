IDEA:
the idea of the project is to implement an automatic form filling software/website.Many a times illiterate people are not able to fill forms due to insufficient knowledge about the technology or due to language barriers. 
to avoid this, we have proposed our solution, which automates most of the form filling procedure.

IMPLEMENTATION:
for the backend work, python 3.7 is used.and for the front end html is used.
for barcode scanner, pyzbar module is used.



WORKING:
1.at first, the barcode is scanned by the camera.
2.which in turn decodes the code, giving the primary key of the database.
3.the row of the primary key is selected from the database.
4.at last, the data acquired from the database is filled into the relevant field in the online form.
